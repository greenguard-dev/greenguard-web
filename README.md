# greenguard

greenguard is a stand-alone plant monitoring system. It was born from the idea of being a lightweight alternative to plant monitoring integrations in Home Assistant.

It has a minimalist user interface, multi-user management and, in addition to automatic monitoring, manual tracking of watering and fertilising behaviour.
